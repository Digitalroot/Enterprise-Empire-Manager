Third Party Game Tools:

There are a number of players and Alliances coming up with some rather 
interesting game tools which some players find quite useful. We would 
urge you to exhibit the utmost of caution when using these tools. Be 
aware that if they require your Session ID and your provide it, it is 
possible that the developer of the tool can take control of your game 
and do with it what s/he wishes with it. The same can be said for your 
Username and Password, although this is even more severe, it is possible 
for the person that created the tool to steal your EA account entirely. 
Never give your account Username and Password to anyone, you are taking 
a massive risk should you do so and could lose access to everything tied 
to that account.

Use of external tools to render information which can already be obtained 
in-game, in a different manner, is allowed with the following stipulations:
• The tool is only allowed to gather and present information that is also 
  available through the official game client.
• The tool is allowed to make direct calls to the Lord of Ultima servers; 
  however the server load created by the tool must be similar to the server 
  load the official game client generates during typical gameplay.
• The tool is NOT allowed to initiate actions for the user.
• EA does NOT check whether a tool is harmful to the user. EA does not give 
  any guarantee about functionality or possible security risks created through 
  the use of tools
• EA has the right to blacklist a tool. If a user is found to be using 
  a tool after it has been officially blacklisted, EA can and will ban 
  the users using this tool.
